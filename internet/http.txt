How internet works??

Router
 - makes sure computer network does not tangle(꼬이다).

 - basically router controls messages between computers.

 - eg. I am using Computer A, and try to send a message to Computer B. Router shows my message and send my message to Computer B.

 - Router has software. => meaning, Router can be a computer. 
 => this means a router can connect another router. 
 
 - Connecting Routers in this way allows them to link multiple computers, which ultimately forms the network infrastructure that  makes up the internet. 

 - this is not only the way to build the internet structure. This will produce many internets that are separated -> this is the negative side.
